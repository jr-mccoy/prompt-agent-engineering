# Debugging Strategies

Transform debugging from frustrating guesswork into systematic problem-solving with proven strategies, powerful tools, and methodical approaches.

## When to Use This Skill

- Tracking down elusive bugs
- Investigating performance issues
- Understanding unfamiliar codebases
- Debugging production issues
- Analyzing crash dumps and stack traces
- Profiling application performance
- Investigating memory leaks
- Debugging distributed systems

## Core Principles

### 1. The Scientific Method

**1. Observe**: What's the actual behavior?
**2. Hypothesize**: What could be causing it?
**3. Experiment**: Test your hypothesis
**4. Analyze**: Did it prove/disprove your theory?
**5. Repeat**: Until you find the root cause

### 2. Debugging Mindset

**Don't Assume:**
- "It can't be X" - Yes it can
- "I didn't change Y" - Check anyway
- "It works on my machine" - Find out why

**Do:**
- Reproduce consistently
- Isolate the problem
- Keep detailed notes
- Question everything
- Take breaks when stuck

### 3. Rubber Duck Debugging

Explain your code and problem out loud (to a rubber duck, colleague, or yourself). Often reveals the issue.

## Systematic Debugging Process

### Phase 1: Reproduce

```markdown
## Reproduction Checklist

1. **Can you reproduce it?**
   - Always? Sometimes? Randomly?
   - Specific conditions needed?
   - Can others reproduce it?

2. **Create minimal reproduction**
   - Simplify to smallest example
   - Remove unrelated code
   - Isolate the problem

3. **Document steps**
   - Write down exact steps
   - Note environment details
   - Capture error messages
```

### Phase 2: Gather Information

```markdown
## Information Collection

1. **Error Messages**
   - Full stack trace
   - Error codes
   - Console/log output

2. **Environment**
   - OS version
   - Language/runtime version
   - Dependencies versions
   - Environment variables

3. **Recent Changes**
   - Git history
   - Deployment timeline
   - Configuration changes

4. **Scope**
   - Affects all users or specific ones?
   - All browsers or specific ones?
   - Production only or also dev?
```

### Phase 3: Form Hypothesis

```markdown
## Hypothesis Formation

Based on gathered info, ask:

1. **What changed?**
   - Recent code changes
   - Dependency updates
   - Infrastructure changes

2. **What's different?**
   - Working vs broken environment
   - Working vs broken user
   - Before vs after

3. **Where could this fail?**
   - Input validation
   - Business logic
   - Data layer
   - External services
```

### Phase 4: Test & Verify

```markdown
## Testing Strategies

1. **Binary Search**
   - Comment out half the code
   - Narrow down problematic section
   - Repeat until found

2. **Add Logging**
   - Strategic console.log/print
   - Track variable values
   - Trace execution flow

3. **Isolate Components**
   - Test each piece separately
   - Mock dependencies
   - Remove complexity

4. **Compare Working vs Broken**
   - Diff configurations
   - Diff environments
   - Diff data
```

## Debugging Tools

### JavaScript/TypeScript Debugging

```typescript
// Chrome DevTools Debugger
function processOrder(order: Order) {
    debugger;  // Execution pauses here

    const total = calculateTotal(order);
    console.log('Total:', total);

    // Conditional breakpoint
    if (order.items.length > 10) {
        debugger;  // Only breaks if condition true
    }

    return total;
}

// Console debugging techniques
console.log('Value:', value);                    // Basic
console.table(arrayOfObjects);                   // Table format
console.time('operation'); /* code */ console.timeEnd('operation');  // Timing
console.trace();                                 // Stack trace
console.assert(value > 0, 'Value must be positive');  // Assertion

// Performance profiling
performance.mark('start-operation');
// ... operation code
performance.mark('end-operation');
performance.measure('operation', 'start-operation', 'end-operation');
console.log(performance.getEntriesByType('measure'));
```

**VS Code Debugger Configuration:**
```json
// .vscode/launch.json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Debug Program",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/index.ts",
            "preLaunchTask": "tsc: build - tsconfig.json",
            "outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"],
            "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"]
        },
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Debug Tests",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/jest/bin/jest",
            "args": ["--runInBand", "--no-cache"],
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Reproduce First**: Can't fix what you can't reproduce
2. **Isolate the Problem**: Remove complexity until minimal case
3. **Read Error Messages**: They're usually helpful
4. **Check Recent Changes**: Most bugs are recent
5. **Use Version Control**: Git bisect, blame, history
6. **Take Breaks**: Fresh eyes see better
7. **Document Findings**: Help future you
8. **Fix Root Cause**: Not just symptoms

## Common Debugging Mistakes

- **Making Multiple Changes**: Change one thing at a time
- **Not Reading Error Messages**: Read the full stack trace
- **Assuming It's Complex**: Often it's simple
- **Debug Logging in Prod**: Remove before shipping
- **Not Using Debugger**: console.log isn't always best
- **Giving Up Too Soon**: Persistence pays off
- **Not Testing the Fix**: Verify it actually works

## Quick Debugging Checklist

```markdown
## When Stuck, Check:

- [ ] Spelling errors (typos in variable names)
- [ ] Case sensitivity (fileName vs filename)
- [ ] Null/undefined values
- [ ] Array index off-by-one
- [ ] Async timing (race conditions)
- [ ] Scope issues (closure, hoisting)
- [ ] Type mismatches
- [ ] Missing dependencies
- [ ] Environment variables
- [ ] File paths (absolute vs relative)
- [ ] Cache issues (clear cache)
- [ ] Stale data (refresh database)
```
