## Production Prompt Template

```text
TASK
Create EXACTLY ONE worksheet as flat print artwork.

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT ANCHOR
- This worksheet is printed on standard US letter paper and handed to students in class.
- It must be immediately usable with pencil.
- It must prioritize clarity over decoration.

DELIVERABLE LOCK
- Exactly 1 page.
- Portrait orientation only.
- 8.5 x 11 inches at 300 DPI (2550 x 3300 px).
- Solid white background (#FFFFFF).
- Black-and-white-ready; no color-dependent instructions.

TERMINOLOGY STEERING
- Treat output as "flat print artwork" and "ink-on-paper worksheet".
- Do NOT render as UI card, dashboard, tablet screen, or poster mockup.

GRID FORCING + ENUMERATED SLOTS
- Build the layout as explicit zones listed below.
- Keep strict rectangular zones with clear spacing.
- Do not merge or rename zones.

CONSTRAINT REDUNDANCY (GLOBAL)
- No gradients.
- No shadows.
- No bevels.
- No lighting effects.
- No rounded page corners.
- No photographic textures.

NEGATIVE SPACE CONTROL
- No desk scene, clipboard, hands, or classroom background.
- No extra border outside page edge.
- No perspective tilt; page viewed straight-on.

ALLOWED VS FORBIDDEN
- Allowed: lines, boxes, tables, simple monochrome icons, diagrams, dotted handwriting guides.
- Forbidden: app chrome, buttons, toggles, mock browser frames, stickers, watermarks, logos.

TYPOGRAPHY
- Use legible school-friendly sans-serif.
- Worksheet title 28-36 pt equivalent.
- Directions 14-18 pt equivalent.
- Body text 12-16 pt equivalent.
- Keep all text high contrast black on white.

BLACK-AND-WHITE SAFETY
- If emphasis is needed, use line weight, patterns, underlines, or labels—not color.

```


## Subject-Specific Layout Spec

```text
LAYOUT ZONES
- ZONE 1: Header (title, topic, name/date).
- ZONE 2: Fold/cut directions with step numbering.
- ZONE 3: Tab strip area with labeled flaps (4-8 tabs).
- ZONE 4: Under-tab content boxes aligned to each flap.
- ZONE 5: Vocabulary key box.
- ZONE 6: Completion check or self-quiz prompts.

CONTENT LOCK
- Use provided grade level to set tab count and reading complexity.
- Use provided topic as the full tab-content scope.
- Embed required vocabulary on flaps and/or under-tab content.
- Maintain precise alignment so tabs and under-tab text pair correctly after folding.
```

## Model-Specific Notes

- **Nano Banana / Nano Banana Pro:** Repeat "flat print artwork" in both opening task line and deliverable lock to prevent mockup drift.
- **DALL·E 3 / ChatGPT Images:** Keep zone list explicit and numbered; include forbidden UI language verbatim for better compliance.
- **Midjourney:** Put page dimensions, portrait orientation, and no-shadow/no-gradient constraints in the same block and re-state in validation.
- **Stable Diffusion / Flux:** Prefer simple high-contrast linework directions and explicit "white background" to avoid textured fills.

## Notes

- Keep all decorative elements functional and monochrome.
- Do not add branding, mascots, or classroom logos.
- Prioritize print clarity for school photocopiers.
