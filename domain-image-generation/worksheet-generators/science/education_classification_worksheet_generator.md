## Production Prompt Template

```text
TASK
Create EXACTLY ONE worksheet as flat print artwork.

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT ANCHOR
- This worksheet is printed on standard US letter paper and handed to students in class.
- It must be immediately usable with pencil.
- It must prioritize clarity over decoration.

DELIVERABLE LOCK
- Exactly 1 page.
- Portrait orientation only.
- 8.5 x 11 inches at 300 DPI (2550 x 3300 px).
- Solid white background (#FFFFFF).
- Black-and-white-ready; no color-dependent instructions.

TERMINOLOGY STEERING
- Treat output as "flat print artwork" and "ink-on-paper worksheet".
- Do NOT render as UI card, dashboard, tablet screen, or poster mockup.

GRID FORCING + ENUMERATED SLOTS
- Build the layout as explicit zones listed below.
- Keep strict rectangular zones with clear spacing.
- Do not merge or rename zones.

CONSTRAINT REDUNDANCY (GLOBAL)
- No gradients.
- No shadows.
- No bevels.
- No lighting effects.
- No rounded page corners.
- No photographic textures.

NEGATIVE SPACE CONTROL
- No desk scene, clipboard, hands, or classroom background.
- No extra border outside page edge.
- No perspective tilt; page viewed straight-on.

ALLOWED VS FORBIDDEN
- Allowed: lines, boxes, tables, simple monochrome icons, diagrams, dotted handwriting guides.
- Forbidden: app chrome, buttons, toggles, mock browser frames, stickers, watermarks, logos.

TYPOGRAPHY
- Use legible school-friendly sans-serif.
- Worksheet title 28-36 pt equivalent.
- Directions 14-18 pt equivalent.
- Body text 12-16 pt equivalent.
- Keep all text high contrast black on white.

BLACK-AND-WHITE SAFETY
- If emphasis is needed, use line weight, patterns, underlines, or labels—not color.

VALIDATION CHECKLIST (must pass before finalizing)
- [ ] Exactly one worksheet page.
- [ ] Portrait 8.5 x 11 in, print-ready.
- [ ] Flat print artwork vocabulary followed.
- [ ] No UI/mockup/staged-photo appearance.
- [ ] No gradients/shadows/rounded corners.
- [ ] Zones follow enumerated layout.
- [ ] Student instructions do not require color.
- [ ] Content matches provided grade, topic, and vocabulary.
```


## Subject-Specific Layout Spec

```text
LAYOUT ZONES
- ZONE 1: Header and sorting rule prompt.
- ZONE 2: Vocabulary key for traits/properties.
- ZONE 3: Item cards/labels to classify.
- ZONE 4: Category table.
- ZONE 5: Compare/contrast questions.
- ZONE 6: Justification sentence stems.

CONTENT LOCK
- Use provided grade level for readability and cognitive load.
- Use provided topic as the only content scope.
- Embed required vocabulary in directions and/or student tasks.
- Keep instructions concise, concrete, and student-facing.
```

## Notes

- Keep all decorative elements functional and monochrome.
- Do not add branding, mascots, or classroom logos.
- Prioritize print clarity for school photocopiers.

## False-Positive Prevention

❌ **DON'T:**
- Accept ZONE 4 categories that overlap — "animals that fly" and "birds" leave the penguin and the bat with no single correct column, so the key marks a defensible answer wrong.
- Use everyday categories as if they were scientific ones: a spider as an insect, a whale as a fish, a mushroom as a plant.
- Let a ZONE 3 item card show a drawing that is ambiguous once photocopied (a seal that could be a sea lion, a moth that could be a butterfly) when the sorting rule depends on that difference.

✅ **DO:**
- Test every ZONE 3 item against every category rule and confirm exactly one rule admits it; rewrite the rule or drop the item if two do, or none.
- Check each item's category against a grade-appropriate reference and mark boundary cases you cannot settle as [VERIFY] before printing the key.
- Count the item cards against the intake number of sorting items.
