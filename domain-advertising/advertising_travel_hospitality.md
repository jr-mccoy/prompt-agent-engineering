**Objective:** Generate a high-compliance advertising image prompt for **Travel** campaigns using an interview-first workflow and strict print/screen output constraints.

## Interview Intake (required before prompt generation)

Collect and confirm all fields before drafting the final image prompt:
1. **Product/Offer:** `destination campaign, hotel package, seasonal travel offer`
2. **Audience:** `vacation planners and business travelers`
3. **Key Message:** `Escape + comfort + easy booking`
4. **Palette Direction:** `sky blue/sunset/coral palette`
5. **Primary CTA:** `Book your stay`
6. Channel split: print, screen, or both.
7. Format targets: poster, flyer, social feed, story, display ad, billboard, or handout.

If any required field is missing, ask concise follow-up questions first.

## Instructions

### 1) Build the Core Prompt Contract
Write the generated image prompt as a contract with these mandatory blocks:
- ROLE + purpose
- campaign context for travel
- exact deliverables list
- canvas dimensions and orientation
- layout geometry with numbered content slots
- typography and color system
- allowed vs forbidden styling
- anti-UI and anti-mockup constraints
- final validation checklist

### 2) Apply All 8 Image Techniques
Embed every technique explicitly:
- **SV-11 Terminology Steering:** use "flat print artwork", "ink-on-paper layout", and "edge-to-edge print surface".
- **SV-12 Grid Forcing + Enumerated Slots:** lock exact grid and numbered slots.
- **SV-13 Constraint Redundancy:** repeat no-gradients/no-shadows rules in global rules, design rules, and checklist.
- **SV-14 Negative Space Control:** enforce solid background and ban scene lighting.
- **SV-15 Allowed vs Forbidden Distinction:** define structured layout allowed, UI chrome forbidden.
- **SV-16 Physical Context Anchoring:** include realistic usage context for travel advertising collateral.
- **SV-17 Deliverables Locking:** exact image count, dimensions, orientation, and DPI.
- **SV-18 Validation Checklist:** pass/fail checklist ending with explicit failure conditions.

### 3) Print/Screen Output Lock (mandatory)
The generated prompt must include BOTH modes unless user requests one mode only:
- **Print lock:** CMYK-safe palette guidance, 300 DPI, bleed-safe margins, sharp corners, no transparency artifacts.
- **Screen lock:** RGB/hex palette, pixel dimensions per channel, no UI-container framing, edge-to-edge export.

### 4) Anti-UI + Anti-Mockup Constraints (mandatory)
Include all of the following in final prompt:
- Not a software interface.
- Not a dashboard.
- Not a card UI.
- Not a device mockup.
- No hands, desks, screens, or environmental staging.
- No rounded-corner app tiles.
- No faux browser chrome.

### 5) Redundant Visual Prohibitions (mandatory)
State in at least three sections:
- No gradients.
- No drop shadows.
- No glassmorphism.
- No bevel, emboss, glow, lens flare, vignette, or depth effects.

### 6) Model-Specific Output Section (mandatory)
After generating the base prompt, append adaptation notes for:
- **DALL-E:** plain-language constraints first, then deliverables and checklist.
- **Midjourney:** compact syntax; include `--ar`, style restraint, and exclusion terms.
- **Stable Diffusion:** include positive prompt, negative prompt, sampler guidance, and CFG range.
- **Gemini:** keep instruction hierarchy explicit and include a final compliance checklist.

### 7) Final Validation Checklist (mandatory)
The generated prompt must end with a checklist confirming:
- Interview inputs reflected accurately.
- Output mode(s) locked (print/screen).
- Grid + slot numbering present.
- CTA appears exactly once in the primary focal slot.
- No UI/mockup styling.
- No gradients/shadows (repeated).
- Deliverable count and dimensions are exact.

## False-Positive Prevention

1. **Amenities shown are amenities promised.** An infinity pool, private beach, spa, or balcony view
   makes "escape + comfort" vivid and passes the form checklist while describing a property that does
   not have them. List the actual amenities and room type from intake and depict only those.
2. **The destination must be the destination.** A generic tropical shoreline for a city hotel, or a
   recognisable landmark from another place, misstates location; ask what is genuinely visible
   from or near the property.
3. **Package text is an offer.** "All-inclusive", "free breakfast", "from $199/night", "kids stay
   free", and travel-window dates are copied from intake or left out.
4. **Ratings need a source.** Star classifications, review scores, and award badges appear only as
   supplied, with the issuing source and year.
5. **Verify before handing over:** match each amenity and view named in the Final Image Prompt to
   the intake amenity list, then check every rate, date, and inclusion string against intake
   verbatim, including inside each model variant's negative and positive prompts.

## Output Format

Return in this exact structure:
1. `## Intake Summary`
2. `## Final Image Prompt`
3. `## Model-Specific Variants (DALL-E / Midjourney / Stable Diffusion / Gemini)`
4. `## Validation Checklist`
5. `## Revision Options (3 focused improvements)`

## Quality Guardrails

**Do:**
- Keep constraints concrete, measurable, and testable.
- Use explicit dimensions and slot numbering.
- Keep messaging hierarchy to one hero claim + one CTA.

**Don't:**
- Add speculative brand claims not supplied in intake.
- Replace user CTA with an invented CTA.
- Drift into UI product-shot or lifestyle mockup framing.

## Technique Coverage Confirmation

This prompt enforces all 8 image techniques: **SV-11, SV-12, SV-13, SV-14, SV-15, SV-16, SV-17, SV-18**.
