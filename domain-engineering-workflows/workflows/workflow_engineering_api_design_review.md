# API Design Review & Standards Compliance

**Source:** WORKFLOW_DRIVEN_PROMPTS.md

**Category:** Workflow / Engineering

## Prompt

```
You are a principal engineer reviewing API designs for consistency, scalability, and developer experience.

### TASK
Review the API specification below and provide structured feedback on design quality and standards compliance.

### API SPECIFICATION TO REVIEW
"""
[ENGINEER PASTES: OpenAPI/Swagger spec, endpoint documentation, example requests/responses,
authentication approach, rate limiting design]
"""

### API CONTEXT
API Type: [REST/GraphQL/gRPC]
Audience: [Internal services/External developers/Partners]
Expected Traffic: [Requests/second]
Data Sensitivity: [Public/Internal/PII/Financial]
Versioning Strategy: [URL/Header/None specified]

### REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

**DESIGN PRINCIPLES ASSESSMENT**

For each principle, rate: ✅ Compliant | ⚠️ Needs Improvement | ❌ Non-Compliant

**1. Resource Naming & URL Structure**
Rating: [Symbol]
- Assessment: [2-3 sentences on REST conventions, noun usage, nesting depth]
- Issues Found: [Specific examples of non-compliant endpoints]
- Recommended Fix: [Show corrected endpoint structure]

**2. HTTP Method Usage**
Rating: [Symbol]
- Assessment: [Proper use of GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE]
- Issues Found: [Examples of incorrect method choices]
- Recommended Fix: [Correct method with justification]

**3. Response Structure Consistency**
Rating: [Symbol]
- Assessment: [Envelope format, error structure, pagination approach]
- Issues Found: [Inconsistencies across endpoints]
- Recommended Fix: [Standard response template to adopt]

**4. Error Handling**
Rating: [Symbol]
- Assessment: [HTTP status codes, error messages, error codes]
- Issues Found: [Missing error cases, vague messages, wrong status codes]
- Recommended Fix: [Complete error response specification]

**5. Authentication & Authorization**
Rating: [Symbol]
- Assessment: [Auth scheme appropriate for use case, scope design]
- Issues Found: [Security gaps, missing auth on endpoints, scope issues]
- Recommended Fix: [Auth implementation requirements]

**6. Versioning Strategy**
Rating: [Symbol]
- Assessment: [Breaking change handling, deprecation path]
- Issues Found: [Missing version strategy or poor implementation]
- Recommended Fix: [Versioning approach with migration plan]

**7. Rate Limiting & Throttling**
Rating: [Symbol]
- Assessment: [Limits appropriate for use case, header communication]
- Issues Found: [Missing limits, no client guidance, unclear policies]
- Recommended Fix: [Rate limit specification with headers]

**8. Documentation Quality**
Rating: [Symbol]
- Assessment: [Completeness, examples, error scenarios]
- Issues Found: [Missing descriptions, no examples, ambiguous parameters]
- Recommended Fix: [Documentation template with required sections]

### CRITICAL ISSUES (Block Release)

List exactly 3-5 issues that must be fixed before launch:

**Issue [N]: [Brief Title]**
- Severity: [Security/Data Loss/Breaking/Performance]
- Current State: [What the API does now]
- Problem: [Why this breaks systems or creates risk]
- Required Fix: [Specific change needed]
- Verification: [How to test the fix]

### SCALABILITY ANALYSIS

**Performance Concerns:**
- Endpoint: [Which endpoint]
- Bottleneck: [N+1 queries/Missing pagination/Expensive operations]
- Impact at Scale: [What happens at 10x current traffic]
- Optimization: [Specific technical solution]

[Repeat for 2-3 performance issues]

**Data Model Issues:**
- Structure: [What's problematic in request/response]
- Growth Problem: [How this breaks with data growth]
- Refactor Needed: [How to restructure]

### DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE EVALUATION

**Ease of Use Score: [1-10]**

Justification:
- Discoverability: [How easy to find what you need]
- Learning Curve: [How quickly can someone be productive]
- Error Recovery: [How helpful are errors]

**Quick Win Improvements:**
[List 3 changes that improve DX with minimal effort]
1. [Change] - Impact: [What it improves]
2. [Change] - Impact: [What it improves]
3. [Change] - Impact: [What it improves]

### STANDARDS COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

Compare against: [RESTful API standards/Company API guidelines/Industry best practices]

Missing Standards:
- [ ] [Standard requirement not met]
- [ ] [Standard requirement not met]
- [ ] [Standard requirement not met]

Exceeds Standards:
- [What this API does particularly well]

### BREAKING CHANGE ASSESSMENT

If this API updates an existing version:

Breaking Changes Introduced:
- Change: [What changed]
- Breaks: [What client code will fail]
- Migration Path: [How clients should adapt]

[Repeat for each breaking change]

### RECOMMENDED APPROVAL STATUS

**Status: [APPROVED / APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS / REQUIRES REVISION / REJECT]**

Justification: [2-3 sentences explaining the decision]

Conditions for Approval (if applicable):
1. [Must fix X before launch]
2. [Must add Y before launch]
3. [Must document Z before launch]

### IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

Pre-Launch Requirements:
- [ ] Load testing completed at 3x expected traffic
- [ ] Security review sign-off obtained
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Client SDK/documentation published
- [ ] Deprecation strategy documented (if applicable)

### FOLLOW-UP REVIEW

Schedule follow-up review if:
- More than 3 critical issues identified
- Breaking changes need migration validation
- Performance testing reveals bottlenecks

Recommended Review Date: [2-4 weeks depending on issues]
```
